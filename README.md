### What is a miscorservice?
A microservice is a software architectural style that structures an application as a collection of small, loosely coupled, and independently deployable services. Each microservice represents a specific business capability and operates as a separate, self-contained unit.


### what is the difference between n-tier and microservices architecture?

N-Tier Architecture is a traditional software architectural style that divides an application into multiple logical layers or tiers. The layers typically include presentation (UI), business logic, and data storage.

Microservices Architecture, on the other hand, is a modern architectural style that structures an application as a collection of small, independent, and loosely coupled services

N-Tier Architecture:

- Monolithic application structure: The application is built as a single, interconnected unit where all layers are tightly integrated.
- Tightly coupled layers: The layers of the application have strong dependencies on each other, making it challenging to modify or replace individual components.
- Shared data and libraries: Components within a layer share the same data and libraries, leading to potential dependencies and constraints.
- Centralized database: The architecture typically uses a single, centralized database that serves all layers of the application.
- Single deployable unit: The entire application is deployed as a single unit, making it difficult to independently deploy or scale specific components.

Microservices Architecture:

- Distributed service-oriented architecture: The application is divided into separate services that operate independently and communicate with each other through well-defined APIs.
- Loosely coupled services: Each microservice is decoupled from others, allowing for independent development, deployment, and scaling.
- Communication through APIs: Microservices interact with each other using lightweight protocols and well-defined interfaces, promoting loose coupling and modularity.
- Autonomous data management per service: Each microservice can have its own dedicated database or data storage, providing autonomy and flexibility.
- Independent deployment and scaling: Microservices can be deployed and scaled independently, allowing for faster iterations and targeted scaling based on demand.

### What is Docker?

Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. Docker enables you to separate your applications from your infrastructure so you can deliver software quickly. With Docker, you can manage your infrastructure in the same ways you manage your applications. By taking advantage of Dockerâ€™s methodologies for shipping, testing, and deploying code quickly, you can significantly reduce the delay between writing code and running it in production.
